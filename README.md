# React-SSR-CSR

Demo test implementing server-side rendering with React, Redux, GraphQL and Apollo.

Motivation for this repo is to provide a playground to experiment with server optimizations and performance increases for react/redux/graphql/apollo-backed applications. 

Optimizations are shown through:
- Caching for reducing network requests
- Serverside rendering (TTIP (time to initial paint)) to load components on the serverside to rid the client from executing requests and downloading all assets before initial load.
